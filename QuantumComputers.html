        <h2>1. Quantum Bits (Qubits):</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Classical computers use bits (0s and 1s) to store and process information, while quantum computers use qubits.</li>
            <li>Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition, allowing for parallel processing of information.</li>
            <li>They can also be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit is dependent on the state of another, even if they are physically separated.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2. Quantum Gates:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Quantum gates are the quantum analogs of classical logic gates. They manipulate qubits to perform quantum computations.</li>
            <li>Common quantum gates include the Hadamard gate, CNOT gate, and T-gate, among others.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3. Quantum Algorithms:

        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Quantum computers have the potential to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers. Some famous quantum algorithms include Shor's algorithm (for factoring large numbers) and Grover's algorithm (for searching unsorted databases).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>4. Quantum Supremacy:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Quantum supremacy refers to the point at which a quantum computer can perform a specific task faster than the best classical supercomputers.</li>
            <li>In 2019, Google claimed to have achieved quantum supremacy with their 53-qubit quantum processor Sycamore.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>5. Quantum Error Correction:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Quantum computers are extremely sensitive to environmental noise and errors. Quantum error correction codes are essential to make quantum computing practical.</li>
            <li>These codes use additional qubits to detect and correct errors in quantum computations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>6. Quantum Hardware:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Several companies and research institutions are actively developing quantum hardware. Notable examples include IBM, Google, Rigetti, and D-Wave</li>
            <li>Quantum computers are typically operated at extremely low temperatures (near absolute zero) to reduce noise and maintain the coherence of qubits.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>7. Quantum Applications:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize various fields, including cryptography, optimization, drug discovery, and materials science.
            </li>
            <li>For example, quantum computers could break existing encryption algorithms, leading to the need for post-quantum cryptography.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>8. Challenges:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Building practical, error-corrected quantum computers is a significant challenge.</li>
            <li>Quantum computers are currently in the research and development stage, and it may be some years before they have broad practical applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>9. Quantum Computing Languages:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Quantum programming languages like Qiskit, Cirq, and Quipper have been developed to write and run quantum algorithms.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>10. Quantum Ethics and Security:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Quantum computing also raises ethical and security concerns, particularly in terms of cryptography and privacy.</li>
        </ul>
